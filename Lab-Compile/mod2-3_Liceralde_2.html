		Since I'm not into those, I don't have a favorite character from an anime, movie, or series; however, SB19 is a PPOP boy band group. Filipino boy 
		band SB19 was established in 2016 by ShowBT Philippines. Pablo, Stell, Ken, Justin, and Josh make up the group. It's been three years since 2020 that 
		I've admired them. I adore their singing, dancing, rapping, and overall humor and wit! I adore Justin's goofy smile, Stell's angelic voice, Josh's 
		engaging demeanor, Ken's dance talents, and Pablo's ability to take charge. Their tunes are motivating as well, and they keep me inspired and driven. 
		I listen to their music when I'm feeling upbeat and when I'm feeling sad or lonely. I can't recall a time when I didn't listen to their music. Due to 
		their dedication and commitment, they serve as an inspiration to me. They communicate with their fan base through vlogs and social media as well. 
		They also had some really inspiring anecdotes from their early lives.
